  # To do this, define a Proc which takes the key of the current item as argument.
  # The example below would add a prefix to each key.

    # Add an item to the primary navigation. The following params apply:
    # key - a symbol which uniquely defines your navigation item in the scope of the primary_navigation
    # name - will be displayed in the rendered navigation. This can also be a call to your I18n-framework.
    # url - the address that the generated item links to. You can also use url_helpers (named routes, restful routes helper, url_for etc.)
    # options - can be used to specify attributes that will be included in the rendered navigation item (e.g. id, class etc.)
    #
    primary.item :offers, 'Offers', admin_offers_path

      #sub_nav.item :key_2_1, 'name', url, options
    #end 
  
    # You can also specify a condition-proc that needs to be fullfilled to display an item.
    # Conditions are part of the options. They are evaluated in the context of the views,
    # thus you can use all the methods and vars you have available in the views.
    #primary.item :key_3, 'Admin', url, :class => 'special', :if => Proc.newÂ { current_user.admin? }
